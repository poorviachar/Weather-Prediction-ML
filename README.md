# Weather-Prediction-ML
This was done as the 6th Semester Machine Learning project. 
The above project contains 4 models for a comparitive study as to which is the most accurate model for rainfall prediction. 
The 4 models are SVM, KNN, ARIMA and Decision trees
For the best results in the decision tree using graphviz use jupyter notebook
